--------

There is currently a problem with facebook authenticaion - will be fixed soon!

------------


This is my facebook clone.
Here I have experiment with new technologies to produce a visually similar clone to facebook, with realtime posting functionality by multiple different users.
The new technologies I have used:
-Tailwind
-Next.js
-Next-auth
-Firebase

Getting started:
-Clone repo to local machine
-In terminal run the following command: "npm run dev"
-Click the "localhost3000" link if the website does not automatically open up
-Login with a facebook account
